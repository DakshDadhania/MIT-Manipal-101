Type 
    undireted graph
    directed graph
    weighted graph(graph with different weights of edges  a->c = 3weight)
        weighted directed graph 
        weighted undirected graph
Node - entity to store data
Edge- connecting nodes
Degree - no of edges connected 
For Directed graph 
    Indegree - No of edges going out 
    Outdegree - no of edges going out 

Mother vertex- the vertex from where you can travel the whole graph

path- sequence of nodes where nodes don't repeat (need not be cyclic) (a node cannot appear twice in a path)
cyclic - a->b->c->d->a if you can reach to the point of starting (non weighted cyclic directed graph)

Acyclic graph a->b->c->d<-a 
Total degree of the graph =2 * no of edges (for undirected graph)


Connected components - when graph is divided to different components then we use visited array to traverse all the components
