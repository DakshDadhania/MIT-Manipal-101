interface mai you can only have method initialized by thier names
exceptions is if you want to declare the method there itself in interface 
use 1. static or
use 2. default 
you can't have normal methods

in abstract class you can have both abstract method(methods without the declaration)
and normal methods 


for incomplete methods 
in interface you need not write anything
but in abstract you have to write abstract
